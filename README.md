# ChristmasProject - MEMORY GAME
Dec. 2020 Christmas Project
Olivia Roh & Owen Smith

A fun memory game for children of ages between 6 to 8 :D

The directions which we followed in order to create this project is as follows:

1. Materials
2. Building the base
3. Coding
4. Put everything together

# Materials

- A cardboard box (+ extra carboard)
- Some rubber bands
- Things to decorate the box(optional)
  - White paint
  - Some red ribbon
- Alligator clips
- A micro:bit
- Some tinfoil
- A pair of headphones or a speaker(aux cord needed)

# Building the base

1. Paint the box white

Above is the original design of the buttons. It was necessary as the micro:bit only has two inputs.
It was modified as it was too complicated and because it was difficult to source materials.
2. 3D print or create the button.
2. Measure and mark the areas which the buttons and the micro:bit will show
3. Cut out the marked areas

# Create car base
1. Measure the dimensions of the motors + wheels, Raspi, the power bank and any other necessary objects.

2. Create a 3D print design of the buggy using the measurements.
3. Print the 3D model.

# Coding
Code buggy movements by using a computer to access the Raspi.
The python code file for this project can be found in the raspibuggyproject repository.

# Put everthing together
![Put everything together](https://i.ibb.co/1J7Pgsg/IMG-2559.jpg)
1. Place all necessary objects in the car base.
2. Make sure the car base is secure.

# What to do with your Raspi buggy
