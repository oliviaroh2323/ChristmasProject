# ChristmasProject - MEMORY GAME
Dec. 2020 Christmas Project
Olivia Roh & Owen Smith

A fun memory game for children of ages between 6 to 8 :D

The directions which we followed in order to create this project is as follows:

1. Materials
2. Building the base
3. Coding
4. Put everything together

# Materials

- A cardboard box (+ extra carboard)
- Some rubber bands
- Things to decorate the box(optional)
  - White paint
  - Some red ribbon
- Alligator clips
- A micro:bit
- Some tinfoil
- A pair of headphones or a speaker(aux cord needed)

# Building the base

1. Paint the box white.
2. Measure and mark the areas which the buttons and the micro:bit will show
3. Cut out the marked areas
![Tinfoil Base]()
4. Add tinfoil bases inside the box.
![Button Plan](https://i.ibb.co/McSK7bg/t-spring.png)
Above is the original design of the buttons. It was necessary as the micro:bit only has two inputs.
It was modified as it was too complicated and because it was difficult to source materials.
The toy now only has one mechanical button(as opposed to the original three-button-plan) that uses a rubber band.
5. 3D print or create the button(s).
6. Add button(s) so that the rubber band will pull it back up once it is pushed down.
7. For non-mechanical buttons, cut slits on the box, then pull through a sheet of tinfoil so that te tinfoil is visible both outside and inside the box.
8. Decorate the box however you want.

# Coding
Code the micro:bit with the help of the [micro:bit Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/2)
![Code Original Plan](https://i.ibb.co/HK73mFW/GAME.png)
Above is the outline for the code. The plan is not completely accurate to the final result.
The python code file for this project can be found in the ChirstmasProject repository.

# Put everthing together
![Put everything together]()
1. Place all necessary objects in the base.
2. Make sure all items is secure.

# What to do with your Raspi buggy
This creation is aimed to be used by a child between the ages of 6 to 8, but its use is not limited to this age group!
